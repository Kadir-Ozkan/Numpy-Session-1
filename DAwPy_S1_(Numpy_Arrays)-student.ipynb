    "## What is NumPy? \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (or Numpy) is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy or Numeric Python is a package for computation on **homogenous n-dimensional arrays**. In numpy dimensions are called as axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need NumPy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A question arises that why do we need NumPy when python lists are already there. The answer to it is we cannot perform operations on all the elements of two list directly. For example, we cannot multiply two lists directly we will have to do it element-wise. This is where the role of NumPy comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries. For more info on why you would want to use Arrays instead of lists, check out this great [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/993984/why-numpy-instead-of-python-lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numpy is/has;\n",
    "\n",
    "**POWERFUL N-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS**<br>\n",
    "Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today.<br>\n",
    "**NUMERICAL COMPUTING TOOLS**<br>\n",
    "NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.<br>\n",
    "**INTEROPERABLE**<br>\n",
    "NumPy supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries.<br>\n",
    "**PERFORMANT**<br>\n",
    "The core of NumPy is well-optimized C code. Enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.<br>\n",
    "**EASY TO USE**<br>\n",
    "NumPy’s high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.<br>\n",
    "**OPEN SOURCE**<br>\n",
    "Distributed under a liberal BSD license, NumPy is developed and maintained publicly on GitHub by a vibrant, responsive, and diverse community. [Source](https://numpy.org/)<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why do we need it?\n",
    "To make a logical and mathematical computation on array and matrices, it is needed. It performs these operations way too efficiently and faster than python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of NumPy\n",
    "1. Numpy arrays take less space.\n",
    "The core of Numpy is its arrays. One of the main advantages of using Numpy arrays is that they take less memory space and provide better runtime speed when compared with similar data structures in python(lists and tuples).NumPy’s arrays are smaller in size than Python lists. A python list could take upto 20MB size while an array could take 4MB. Arrays are also easy to access for reading and writing.\n",
    "2. The speed performance is also great. It performs faster computations than python lists.\n",
    "3. Numpy support some specific scientific functions such as linear algebra. They help us in solving linear equations.\n",
    "4. Numpy support vectorized operations, like elementwise addition and multiplication, computing Kronecker product, etc. Python lists fail to support these features.\n",
    "5. It is a very good substitute for MATLAB, OCTAVE, etc as it provides similar functionalities and supports with faster development and less mental overhead(as python is easy to write and comprehend)\n",
    "6. As it is open-source, it doesn’t cost anything, and it uses a very popular programming language, Python, which has high-quality libraries for almost every task. Also, it is easy to connect the existing C code to the Python interpreter.\n",
    "7. NumPy is very good for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages of NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using “nan” in Numpy: “Nan” stands for “not a number”. It was designed to address the problem of missing values. NumPy itself supports “nan” but lack of cross-platform support within Python makes it difficult for the user. That’s why we may face problems when comparing values within the Python interpreter.\n",
    "2. Require a contiguous allocation of memory: Insertion and deletion operations become costly as data is stored in contiguous memory locations as shifting it requires shifting.\n",

    "- The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory. The exception: one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, thereby allowing for arrays of different sized elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are using NumPy arrays; though these typically support Python-sequence input, they convert such input to NumPy arrays prior to processing, and they often output NumPy arrays. In other words, in order to efficiently use much (perhaps even most) of today’s scientific/mathematical Python-based software, just knowing how to use Python’s built-in sequence types is insufficient - one also needs to know how to use NumPy arrays.\n",
